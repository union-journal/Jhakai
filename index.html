      There is nothing here, yet my joy. Here, my joy has happened without me
      and it remembers me. I was small, and little, and smaller than the rest
      who it reached. The rest who could glance this way and that, with a
      mobility permitted by a no. No to the slice in the smile of old wood and
      no to the curvature of waiting. This is where I am, where I have said
      neither no or yes, and my joy is listening with nails, listening from the
      outskirts. Besides me, the unraveled spools of wandering and threatening
      hate. And who will jewel it besides my mother? Is it me? Me with the
      inherited inheritance of broken and imported lime luck. Me, with the
      mirror cropped out. I’m hearing nothing in this place. I’m hearing a car
      on a string, and it hurts right here. And there is no place to go, here,
      where there is nothing, yet my joy. So on the bend of my upturned
      curiosity are the rest looking down at me, and there I am at the top with
      the rest of myself, holding the bars of the prison I’ve made of my peace.
      Hoping for an escape from my freedom, or hoping for something smaller than
      escape. I only want her who is Billie to notice, if she’s still there in
      the corner eating saltines, and singing saltines. I only want him to be
      her, if it’s loud enough to crash the big wedding that never happened,
      that keeps happening in the hurt. It may have to be here, with the
      terrible comfort of a slow river, that I wait no longer to wait. That I
      look out from my memory with gloves, and that I reach for the unsullied
      spoils of indifference. That time where freedom could not afford me. When
      it came with slippers and left with slippers. Here is a place where I have
      shared without sharing. Here is a place where behind me stood the
      steadiness of my shy misfortune. And now and still, and forever, will it
      be with me I hope, and tremble. I hope and tremble. I hope and tremble.

        Tallest<br />
        amongst women,<br />
        will be the last to<br />
        have seen the sun. <br /><br />
        from the baker’s chain <br />
        sneaking,<br />
        goes my brother,<br />
        growing.<br />
        enough road<br />
        to lose<br />
        his paleness.<br />
        to break cups<br />
        in his hands<br />
        is to break the evening walk<br />
        to East Virginia, <br /><br />
        and the one repeating woman<br />
        has left her shadow<br />
        to dry in winter,<br />
        to walk<br />
        while nothing else can come,<br />
        but more of this land marked<br />
        by her lion tongue. <br /><br />
        and he was resting with agreed hands,<br />
        to work on love<br />
        as if it’s done,<br />
        doing what it does to men,<br />
        near to no one held dear,<br />
        but then the toy wounded<br />
        in the backseat of a car <br /><br />
        made the woman<br />
        worry herself<br />
        till worry left her completely.<br /><br />
        Which then<br />
        could have been<br />
        how I lost them both. <br /><br />
        The way the spending is done<br />
        on worthy horses,<br />
        could have been<br />
        a decent memory<br />
        to pass,<br />
        but along <br /><br />
        this divide<br />
        there is only<br />
        cold food to break in half.<br />

      Honesty is a sniff isn’t it? It’s the nose torture, the mouth hiding, and
      the eyes becoming slits and bearing gifts. I like that face, but not when
      it’s mine. Then it’s boring because then it’s my nose torture, my mouth
      hiding, and my eyes becoming slits. I don’t like my face like that,
      because I have a big nose, says my husband. I have a big mouth, says my
      husband. I have preacher eyes off the stove, says my husband. Honesty?
      Doesn’t that mean resting? Like when your ears are at the same height as
      your feet and any walking that you’re doing has got to stop because your
      ears are on the floor too and god forbid that. My husband says that’s
      silly. Ears should never be on the floor he says. The floor is a place
      only for your feet, but I don’t think that’s true if you’re sleeping and
      especially if you’re being honest. Sleeping is too important for me,
      especially, if no one is there, because everyone is there then, they are
      just below. When I say they are below, I mean they are under, and under
      the floor watching you sleep and watching you be honest. Their ears are
      pressed against the wood, or the cement, or whatever material and they are
      there not to watch you sleep, but to watch you be honest! And who are they
      besides your husband’s friends! No, they’re your friends too if you’re
      being honest! And isn’t honesty just the pipes breaking. The rush of spit
      from your mother that you dodged and dodged until it got you and then your
      husband said what’s that and you said it was sparkling water you wiped on
      your face after washing up. And when he asked why, you said it was for
      him. You said your mother’s spit was for him, but he thought you were
      talking about the sparkling water, but you were talking about the water
      that belongs on the floor but that somehow found itself on your face. And
      you believe in enemies, and he doesn’t. He believes in you, but you don‘t
      because instead you are believing in battle. Because you do not like your
      face and you do not like being honest. Honesty is so sweet, but you will
      not do that beehive work. Honesty is so sweet, but you will not torture
      your nose to sniff endlessly flowers that will do nothing for you. Honesty
      is so sweet, but you do not like the flowers that will have honey for the
      colony, honey for the colony, honey for the colony. And you are not the
      colony. No, you are dishonest wife.
